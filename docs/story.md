In the peaceful land of Taskonia, every task lived as a tiny glowing orb.  
One day, Linked-List Hamza decided to organize all the tasks into a magical chain.  
He created a path where every orb was linked to the next.  
Stack Abdullah ensured every new idea joined the story properly.  
Queue Adan arrived to help, making sure tasks were completed in the order they appeared.  
When a task was completed, Hamza removed the orb from the chain,  
Abdullah handled the latest additions,  
and Adan ensured the earliest tasks left first, keeping everything fair.  
The citizens praised how the chain grew, shrunk, and flowed smoothly.  
Together, the three built the Task To-Do System using a Singly Linked List, Stack, and Queue.  
Users could add, remove, and view tasks in the glowing chain.  
The Linked List, Stack, and Queue warriors helped everyone stay organized.  
Their adventure continues as the system evolves.
