	In the peaceful land of Taskonia, every task lived as a tiny glowing orb.
	One day, Linked-List Hamza decided to organize all the tasks into a magical chain.
	He created a path where every orb was linked to the next.
	Stack Abdullah ensured every new idea joined the story properly.
	When a task was completed, Hamza removed the orb from the chain.
	The citizens praised how the chain grew and shrunk dynamically.
	Together, the two built the Task To-Do System using a Singly Linked List.
	Users could add, remove, and view tasks in the glowing chain.
	The Linked List warriors helped everyone stay organized.
	Their adventure continues as the system evolves.
